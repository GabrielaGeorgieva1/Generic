# Java Technical Questionnaire

These are the theoretical questions that will most likely be asked during the project defenses and during the technical part of your job interviews. The idea of these questions is for them to act like a learning guide and provide the student an accurate way of measuring their understanding of the key concepts behind each course and module. As you can see, they are separated into two groups.

**1.   The first group are questions that we expect you know the answer of in great details and could answer and explain additional questions regarding them. These questions are related to the material we have covered during our onsite classes.**

**2.   The second set consists of questions that we expect you to know about and can give a basic answer, without diving deep into the subject. These questions are usually based on additional resources we provide inside the Learning Management System. You should research those topics in your spare time.**

## Logical Tasks

- You are given two eggs, and access to a 100-storey building. Both eggs are identical. The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again. However, once an egg is broken, that’s it for that egg. If an egg breaks when dropped from floor n, then it would also have broken from any floor above that. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that. The question is: What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution?. (And what is the worst case for the number of drops it will take?)
